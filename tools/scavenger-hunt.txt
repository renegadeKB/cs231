1. 
Use ifconfig -a or ip addr, then look for inet/inet6. These will be your wireless ip addresses. Your ethernet should be in the en or eth section 
2.
ping <hostname> will tell you, or dig <hostname>
3.
nslookup <IP> or dig <IP>
4.
scp <sourcefile> <ssh user@hostname/destination/path> will securely transfer files using ssh. You can try rsync if ssh isn't allowed, but it won't be secure.
5.
 netstat -tulpn | grep :<port number> will show you just those listening on a specific port.
6.
netstat -tulpn will show you all TCP and UDP ports that are being listened on, and give you the PID and name of the listener's process if you are a root/sudo user.
7.
curl -o <destination/path.txt> <domain> or wget <domain> -O </destination/path.txt>
8.
curl -I <domain> will show you the headers, though wget and telnet have options to do so as well.
9.
curl -D - -o /dev/null <domain> will do it. -D - will send the output to stdout, and -o/dev/null ignores the response.
